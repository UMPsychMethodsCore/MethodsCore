NBS is a software package designed for testing hypotheses about the human connectome. It is made freely available to the neuroimaging community under the GNU General Public Licence. 

NBS takes as input a series of connectivity matrices from different cohorts, or from the same subject during different experimental conditions. The connectivity matrices are typically derived from neuroimaging data processed with other software packages. The user specifies the hypothesis to be tested at every connection with the general linear model. One of three techniques can then be selected to test significance and identify specific connections/subnetworks for which the null hypothesis can be rejected:
