Opening NBS for the first time populates the user inputs to enable replication of the disrupted network reported in the originating NBS paper. This disrupted network represents reduced functional connectivity in a group of 12 people with schizophrenia, compared to 15 healthy controls. Functional connectivity was measured between pairs of nodes using the correlation between their wavelet-decomposed resting-state time series.
