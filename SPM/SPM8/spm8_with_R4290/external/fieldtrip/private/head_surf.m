function [pnt,tri]=head_surf(vol,grad,flag);

% HEAD_SURF determines the head surface from a multisphere headmodel
% and a set of coils in the MEG gradiometer system and returns a
% triangulation
% 
% Use as
%   [pnt, tri] = head_surf(vol, grad, flag) 
% where
%   grad    gradiometer definition
%   vol     multisphere volume conductor definition
%
% If flag=1 the lower rim of the helmet-shaped head surface will
% be shifted downward, if flag=0 it will not be shifted downward.
% The default is flag=1.
%
% The head surface triangulation can be used in combination with
% ft_inside_vol to determine which voxels of a beamformer scan 
% are located within the head (region of interest).
