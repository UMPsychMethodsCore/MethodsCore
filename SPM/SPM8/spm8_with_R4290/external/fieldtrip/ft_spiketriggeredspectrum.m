function [freq] = ft_spiketriggeredspectrum(cfg, data)

% FT_SPIKETRIGGEREDSPECTRUM computes the Fourier spectrup of the LFP around the spikes.
%
% Use as
%   [freq] = ft_spiketriggeredspectrum(cfg, data)
%
% The input data should be organised in a structure as obtained from
% the FT_APPENDSPIKE function. The configuration should be according to
%
%   cfg.timwin       = [begin end], time around each spike (default = [-0.1 0.1])
%   cfg.foilim       = [begin end], frequency band of interest (default = [0 150])
%   cfg.taper        = 'dpss', 'hanning' or many others, see WINDOW (default = 'hanning')
%   cfg.tapsmofrq    = number, the amount of spectral smoothing through
%                      multi-tapering. Note that 4 Hz smoothing means
%                      plus-minus 4 Hz, i.e. a 8 Hz smoothing box.
%                      Note: multitapering rotates phases (no problem for consistency)
%   cfg.spikechannel = string, name of single spike channel to trigger on
%   cfg.channel      = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'),
%                      see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
%   cfg.feedback     = 'no', 'text', 'textbar', 'gui' (default = 'no')
%
% If the triggered spike leads a spike in another channel, then the angle
% of the Fourier spectrum of that other channel will be negative. NOTE that
% this should be checked for consistency.
%
% NOTE: Function should be merged with ft_spike_triggeredspectrum
