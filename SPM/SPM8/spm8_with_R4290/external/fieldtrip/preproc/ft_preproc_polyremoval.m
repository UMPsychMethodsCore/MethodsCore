function dat = ft_preproc_polyremoval(dat, order, begsample, endsample)

% FT_PREPROC_POLYREMOVAL removed an Nth order polynomal from the data
% 
% Use as
%   dat = ft_preproc_polyremoval(dat, order, begsample, endsample)
% where
%   dat        data matrix (Nchans X Ntime)
%   order      the order of teh polynomial
%   begsample  index of the begin sample for the estimate of the polynomial
%   endsample  index of the end sample for the estimate of the polynomial
%
% If begsample and endsample are not specified, it will use the whole
% window to estimate the polynomial.
%
% For example
%   ft_preproc_polyremoval(dat, 0)
% removes the basline by de-meaning the data and 
%   ft_preproc_polyremoval(dat, 1)
% removes the mean and the linear trend.

% take the whole segment if begsample and endsample are not specified
if nargin==2,
  begsample = 1;
  endsample = size(dat,2);
end

% construct a "time" axis
nsamples = size(dat,2);
basis    = [1:nsamples];

% create a set of basis functions that will be fitted to the data
x = zeros(order+1,nsamples);
for i = 0:order
  x(i+1,:) = basis.^(i);
end

% estimate the contribution of the basis functions
a = dat(:,begsample:endsample)/x(:,begsample:endsample);

% remove the estimated basis functions
dat = dat - a*x;
