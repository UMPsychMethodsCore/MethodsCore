function [vol, sens] = prepare_vol_sens(vol, sens, varargin)

% PREPARE_VOL_SENS does some bookkeeping to ensure that the volume
% conductor model and the sensor array are ready for subsequent forward
% leadfield computations. It takes care of some pre-computations that can
% be done efficiently prior to the leadfield calculations.
%
% Use as
%   [vol, sens] = prepare_vol_sens(vol, sens, ...)
% with input arguments
%   sens   structure with gradiometer or electrode definition
%   vol    structure with volume conductor definition
%
% The vol structure represents a volume conductor model, its contents
% depend on the type of model. The sens structure represents a sensor
% array, i.e. EEG electrodes or MEG gradiometers.
%
% Additional options should be specified in key-value pairs and can be
%   'channel'    cell-array with strings (default = 'all')
%   'order'      number, for single shell "Nolte" model (default = 10)
%
% The detailled behaviour of this function depends on whether the input
% consists of EEG or MEG and furthermoree depends on the type of volume
% conductor model:
% - in case of EEG single and concentric sphere models, the electrodes are
%   projected onto the skin surface.
% - in case of EEG boundary element models, the electrodes are projected on
%   the surface and a blilinear interpoaltion matrix from vertices to
%   electrodes is computed.
% - in case of MEG and a multispheres model, a local sphere is determined
%   for each coil in the gradiometer definition.
%  - in case of MEG with a singleshell Nolte model, the volume conduction
%    model is initialized
% In any case channel selection and reordering will be done. The channel
% order returned by this function corresponds to the order in the 'channel'
% option, or if not specified, to the order in the input sensor array.
