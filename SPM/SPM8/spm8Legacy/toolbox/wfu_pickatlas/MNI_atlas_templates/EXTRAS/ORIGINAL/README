WFU Pickatlas MNI TD Templates

This folder contains the original Analyze Image Format versions of the MNI normalized Talairach Daemon database volumes.  These images have not been extended to the vertex.

To use these instead of the extended volumes, place the files in the MNI_atlas_templates folder and update the master_lookup.txt file to point to these filenames.
