% ConnTool Example
% August 2013
% 
% Ann Arbor MI
% 
% The file test_ConnTool_01.sh demonstrates how to use the ConnTool through
% a bash script. This will allow for you to run the command in the background
% of any unix-like system (Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, etc). 
% 
% Read the file and see the contents. There is also an example matlab script
% in this directory called ConnTool_PCC_3.m. You shoudl also look at this file.
% 
% Finally, an example saved parameters file is contained. To avoid matlab 
% warning messages you should addpath to SPM8 and also run "spm('defaults','fmri')"
%
% This file can either by viewed in an editor, or just by executing it.
% 
% Good luck!!!
