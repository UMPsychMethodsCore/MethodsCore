<h4> Percent Variance </h4>
<hr> 

Percent variance utility can be used after running a group ICA analysis. Percent 
variance explained by the components in the data is calculated by doing a 
Multiple Regression of the BOLD signal and the component time courses at each 
voxel where the component time courses are treated as a model. After the 
calculation is done, the final result is printed to the MATLAB command window.
