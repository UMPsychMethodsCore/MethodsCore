      <h4> Remove Component(s)</h4>
      <hr> 
      <p>Artifact signals like eye blinks, eye movements, muscle 
      activity, etc make the detection of brain activity difficult. Therefore, 
      signal processing techniques should be used to remove the artifacts from 
      the data. ICA can be used to remove the components from the fMRI data. 
      This can be done in GIFT by selecting 'Remove Component(s)' entry 
      from the <a href="icatb_getting_started.htm">Utilities drop down box</a>. After 
      the calculation is done, new set of images with prefix 'R_' are written in the 
		selected output directory.&nbsp; These new set of images can 
      be analyzed using ICA or SPM.</p>
