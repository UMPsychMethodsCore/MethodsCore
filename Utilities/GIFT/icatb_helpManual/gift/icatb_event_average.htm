<h4> Event Average </h4>
<hr>
<p> Event average can be done in two ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Method 1: After <a href="icatb_temporal_sorting.htm">temporal sorting</a> of components, when you click on 
  the <a href="icatb_expanded_view_tc.htm">expanded view</a> of time course and 
	had selected "Event Average" under "Utilities" menu.
  </li>
  <li>
Method 2:
Select "Event Average" entry under <a href="icatb_getting_started.htm"> Utilities drop 
down box</a>. This will let you select the data-sets, regressor and component required for the event average.
 </li>
</ul>

<p> Event average of ICA time course is calculated based on the onsets of the 
selected model time course (See Figure 1). The parameters needed for event 
average are window size and interpolation factor (specified in
<a href="icatb_options_window.htm"> options window</a>). The procedure for calculating 
the event average is given below:</p>

<p class="style1">Figure 1: Reference functions used during temporal sorting. </p>

<p class="style1"> <img src="images/icatb_ref_func_event_avg.jpg"></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  The interpolation factor is multiplied with TR (See
  <a href="icatb_SPM_design_matrix.htm">SPM design matrix</a>). The ICA time 
	course is interpolated by the scaled interpolation factor.</li>
  <li>
  Onsets of the selected model time course (Sn(1)right_visual_hemisphere*bf(1) 
  in Figure 1) are used. If the units are in seconds, the selected onsets are 
  divided by TR.</li>
  <li>Window size is multiplied by the original interpolation factor. Event average 
  is initialized to zero vector of length equal to the scaled window size.</li>
  
  <li>Loop is done over the length of the selected onsets. </li>
  <li>
  
  Starting index corresponds to current selected onset value multiplied by 
  scaled interpolation factor. All the indices from starting index to length of 
  the scaled window size are used. Time course values of the corresponding 
  indices are added to the event average.</li>
  <li>Number of onset where ending index exceeds the size of the time course is 
  determined. </li>
  
  <li>End of loop over the selected onsets</li>
  
  <li> Event average is divided by number of onset where index exceeds the size of 
  the time course. </li>
</ul>

<p> Figure 2 shows the event averages of the ICA time courses with the defaults from 
the <a href="icatb_expanded_view_tc.htm">expanded view</a> of the ICA time 
course. Event averages of the <a href="icatb_adjust_ica.htm">adjusted</a> time courses are shown in figure 3.
