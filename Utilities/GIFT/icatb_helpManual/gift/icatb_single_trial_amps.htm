<h4> Single Trial Amplitudes </h4>
<hr> 
<p> 
Single trial amplitudes are the beta weights which are obtained by
doing a Multiple Regression of the design matrix and the convolved
ICA time course where the design matrix is obtained by doing a
convolution of the onsets and the event averages. This utility must
be used after doing temporal sorting of all data-sets in the GIFT
and using only the regressors of interest. The best regressor onsets
for each data set are used to compute single trial amplitudes and
event averages. We determine the best regressor for each data-set
based on the maximum beta weight value (not the absolute value).
Figure 1 shows the orthogonal slices
at the maximum voxel, event average and the single trial amplitudes
for the selected components. We also store the single trial
amplitude results in a file having suffix
'*single_trial_results.mat'.
