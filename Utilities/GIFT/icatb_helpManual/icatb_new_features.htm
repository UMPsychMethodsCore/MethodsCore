<h4> New Features </h4>
<hr>

<b>GroupICAT v2.0d with the release date March 31, 2010: </b>

<ul>

<li> Added data pre-processing options like intensity normalization, variance 
normalization and removing mean time-series. Intensity normalization is 
recommended for maximizing the reliability and replicability of the components. 
Please see E. Allen, E. Erhardt, T. Eichele, A. R. Mayer, and V. D. Calhoun, "Comparison of pre-normalization methods on the accuracy of group ICA results," in Proc. HBM, Barcelona, Spain, 2010 for more details. </li>

<li> Added expectation maximization option to PCA computation (S.Roweis, &quot;EM 
algorithms for PCA and sensible PCA&quot;, Advances in Neural Information Processing 
Systems. 1998). EM PCA has fewer memory constraints compared to covariance based 
PCA and is the preferred method for very large data-set analysis. </li>


<li> All the subsequent analysis MAT files after PCA with the exception of 
ICASSO will be converted to single precision if you have selected single 
precision in the PCA options. This is recommended for maximizing the number of 
data sets given a fixed amount of RAM. </li>

<li> GICA3 back reconstruction method was released as an update to GroupICAT 
v2.0c. GICA3 is the recommended method for reconstructing individual subject 
components with the most accurate spatial maps and timecourses. GICA3 has two 
desirable properties that the sum of the subject spatial maps is the aggregate 
spatial map and the product of the time courses and spatial maps estimate the 
data to the accuracy of the PCA's. We have performed extensive comparison with 3 
different PCA/data-reduction approaches and 4 back-reconstruction approaches 
including spatio-temporal regression/dual regression. These approaches are 
included as options in GIFT. Please see E. Erhardt, S. Rachakonda, E. Bedrick, T. Adali, and V. D. Calhoun, "Comparison of multi-subject ICA methods for analysis of fMRI data," in Proc. HBM, Barcelona, Spain, 2010. 
 </li>

<li> Component images sign in ICA is flipped based on the skewness measure of 
the distribution (previously it was flipped based upon the maximum voxel). </li>


<li> Subject component image distributions are centered to zero by default when 
scaling component images. Centering is done based on the peak of the 
distribution. </li>

<li> &quot;icatb_mem_ica.m&quot; script is updated to include all the data reduction 
strategies and will give a close estimate of how much RAM is required for all 
the analysis types. </li>


<li> ICASSO can now be acessed from Setup ICA GUI. </li>

<li> Dimensionality estimation source code (&quot;icatb_estimate_dimension.m&quot;) 
developed by Leo Li is now available. </li>

<li> Batch script doesn't read &quot;numOfPC3&quot; variable if only two data reduction 
steps are used. </li>

<li> Bug was fixed in the back reconstruction code (GroupICAT v2.0c Updates, 
March 11, 2010) to handle &quot;Constrained ICA (Spatial)&quot; algorithm. </li>

<li> Covariance options is replaced with PCA options and will be available when 
you select the PCA type in Setup ICA GUI. </li>

</ul>

<hr>

<b>GroupICAT v2.0c with the release date August 17, 2009: </b>

<ul>

<li> Enabled two data reduction steps in Setup ICA when the number of subjects 
is greater than 10. </li>
<li> Two data reduction steps method is handled better in terms of memory usage 
for analyzing very large datasets. </li>
<li> Added C-MEX files for computing eigen values of a symmetric matrix using 
packed storage scheme (this approach is slightly slower, but less memory 
intensive).</li>
<li> Added spatial-temporal back reconstruction approach (this is an alternative 
approach to back-reconstruction and computes a spatial regression of the 
aggregate component images onto each timepoint of the single subject data and 
then computes a temporal regression of the single subject component timecourses 
onto each voxels timecourse). Results are quite similar to back-reconstruction 
using the PCA de-whitening matrix.</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<b>GroupICAT v2.0b with the release date April 2, 2009: </b>
<ul>
<li> Single trial amplitudes utility based on Dr. Tom Eichele's work is now 
added to the GIFT toolbox.</li>
<li> Added an option in the batch script to select the input data using regular 
expression pattern match. This can be used to get the directories that are 
highly nested.</li>
<li> We now remove the limitation to use MATLAB Statistics toolbox to compute 
statistics on the time courses. </li>
<li> Added Multiple Regression design criteria in the Stats on time courses GUI. </li>

</ul>

<hr>
<b>GroupICAT v2.0a with the release date April 11, 2008: </b>
<ul>
<li>We now provide EEGIFT toolbox for analyzing group ICA on EEG data (By Tom 
Eichele). EEGIFT contains options for importing data in .SET format from EEGLAB 
and visualization methods for viewing group ICA components. Both GIFT and EEGIFT 
are subsumed within GroupICAT v2.0a.</li>

<li> Temporal sorting in GIFT is optimized. We load .MAT files for individual 
subject components instead of using time course images.</li>
<li> Event average using deconvolution method (By Tom Eichele) is implemented. </li>

selecting multiple regressors and components. Event average results will be
