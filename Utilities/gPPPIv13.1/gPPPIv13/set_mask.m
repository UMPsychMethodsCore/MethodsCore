function [xY,errorchk]=set_mask(SPM,VOI,region1,maskdir)
%% Checks if xY.mask exists. 
% If VOI is an image, read the header into xY.mask.
% If xY.mask does not exist, then a mask image (.nii) is created via 
% mask_create and the the header is read into xY.mask.
% If xY.mask does exist, then it checks the format of xY.mask
% There are also some other error checks below as well. The errors should
% be clear enough to correct the problems.
% Results of this function, which is called by timeseries_extract, is
% xY.mask.
