function spmhdr=create_mask_image(SPM,region,VOI,maskdir)
%% Creates a mask image (to extract data) from the VOI specifications 
% Uses the space of the first-level data to create an image that is the
% same size. region is the name of the file. VOI is the specifications of
% the spatial locations (in mm) of the VOI. maskdir is the output
% directory. Since this is only called from set_mask, there is no error
% check. If called independently, use with caution.
