% Flatten Upper Trianngle - A function to extract, as a vector, the upper

% the upper triangle are inf, this will lead to an error.
% NOTE - It will strip logicals down to doubles and return as such

% Check if any elements are inf.
if any(isnan(squaremat(:)))
    % raise error message and abort. Add this functionality once mc_error
    % is written.
