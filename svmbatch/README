SVM Batch

Written 2011 by Daniel Kessler, kesslerd@umich.edu

**Prerequisites**
This was code was written and tested in AFNI_2011_05_26_1457


This batch script should not require any modification by you. Instead, you customize it by editing the support text files that come with it, namely:

*svmdir
This file should contain a path to an extant directory where the script should store all of its intermediates and results

*filelist1
This should contain a whitespace-delimted list of (ideally absolute) paths to files that 3dsvm will consider to be examples of class 1. If you are giving it data from img/hdr pairs, be sure to point to the hdr (it will figure out where the img is based on the hdr).

*filelist2
Just like filelist1, except these are files that represent examples from class 2.

That's it. Other support files may be added as we extend functionality.


**Likely future additions

1) Automatic testing of model on training set
2) Automated partitioning of examples into training set and test set for model cross-validation
3) Permutation testing. This will be computationally intensive, but not too hard to implement.
