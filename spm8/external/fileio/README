This is a special release of the FieldTrip FILEIO module for inclusion
in SPM8. It contains functions for reading EEG and MEG data from a
large variety of files. Furthermore, additional information such
as sensor positions can be read from file.

This particular release has wrapper functions that adhere to the
spm_xxx function naming style. The public functions are available
as ft_xxx, whereas all dependencies are hidden in the private
directory. If you are interested in using this toolbox independent
of SPM8, I suggest that you visit http://www.ru.nl/fcdonders/fieldtrip
and download a normal and more complete version.

For more information please visit http://www.ru.nl/fcdonders/fieldtrip
and http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm.
