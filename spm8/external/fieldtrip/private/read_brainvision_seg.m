function [dat] = read_brainvision_seg(filename, hdr, begsample, endsample);

% READ_BRAINVISION_SEG reads raw data from an segmented EEG file
% and returns it as a Nchans x Nsamples matrix.  The data is read
% as if it were continuous data, this function does not check whether
% the specified begin and endsample are withing the same segment.
%
% Use as
%   dat = read_brainvision_seg(filename, hdr, begsample, endsample) 
% where the header should be first read using read_brainvision_vhdr

% Revision 1.1  2009/01/14 09:12:15  roboos
% The directory layout of fileio in cvs sofar did not include a
% private directory, but for the release of fileio all the low-level
% functions were moved to the private directory to make the distinction
% between the public API and the private low level functions. To fix
% this, I have created a private directory and moved all appropriate
% files from fileio to fileio/private.

% Revision 1.4  2008/04/09 10:11:23  roboos
% renamed nChans into the original form, converted from dos to unix
%
% Revision 1.3  2007/06/13 08:08:19  roboos
% changed single & into &&
%
% Revision 1.2  2004/03/30 08:22:19  roberto
% fixed bug due to renaming NumberOfChannels -> nChans
%
% Revision 1.1  2004/03/30 07:23:28  roberto
% added to CVS repository, copyrights added and implemented multiple file
% formats
