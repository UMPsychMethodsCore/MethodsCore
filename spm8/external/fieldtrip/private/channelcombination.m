function [collect] = channelcombination(channelcmb, datachannel)

% CHANNELCOMBINATION creates a cell-array with combinations of EEG/MEG
% channels for subsequent cross-spectral-density and coherence analysis
%
% You should specify channel combinations as a two-column cell array,
%   cfg.channelcmb = {  'EMG' 'MLF31'
%                       'EMG' 'MLF32'
%                       'EMG' 'MLF33' };
% to compare EMG with these three sensors, or
%   cfg.channelcmb = { 'MEG' 'MEG' };
% to make all MEG combinations, or
%   cfg.channelcmb = { 'EMG' 'MEG' };
% to make all combinations between the EMG and all MEG channels.
%
% For each column, you can specify a mixture of real channel labels
% and of special strings that will be replaced by the corresponding
% channel labels. Channels that are not present in the raw datafile
% are automatically removed from the channel list.

% prevent memory allocation and copying in a for loop, this was the

% Revision 1.11  2005/09/29 00:46:11  roboos
% renamed the variable sgncmb into channelcmb, both in the help and code
%
% Revision 1.10  2005/05/17 17:50:36  roboos
% changed all "if" occurences of & and | into && and ||
